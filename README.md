# Lion Dance Beats

In my brief exposure to traditional Chinese lion dancing, I've found interest in lion dance drumming and its different styles and beats.  I've taken the liberty of transcribing some of my favorite sequences here, most of which are taken from drumming videos on YouTube with minor modifications on my end.  All credit goes to the original performers.

The sequences are transcribed in a variation of [Jianpu notation](http://debussy.music.ubc.ca/Helpfiles/IPad/pages/CypherNotation.html) using my own symbols that I've found convenient.

**Disclaimer:** I am neither a pro lion dancer nor a musician—just a lion dance enthusiast!  So please forgive any technical errors in the transcriptions, or better yet, let me know so that I can learn more!
